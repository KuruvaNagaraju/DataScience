## üìÅ Project Structure

Each project directory typically contains:

- `README.md`: Detailed explanation of the project, including problem statement, approach, and results.
- `data/`: Sample datasets or links to data sources.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks illustrating the data exploration, modeling, and evaluation processes.
- `src/`: Source code scripts for data processing, model training, and utility functions.
- `models/`: Saved model files and checkpoints.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required to run the project.
